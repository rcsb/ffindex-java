# Overview

FFindex is a very simple index/database for huge amounts of small files. The files are stored concatenated in one big 
data file, seperated by `\0`. A second file contains a plain text index, giving name, offset and length of the small 
files.

# Performance

Performance was measured on a collection of 190k BinaryCIF files (stored as `.bcif.gz`). Multi-threaded operations could
use up to 12 cores.

## Read Times (JMH)
| Approach | read 1,000 random files [ms] |
| --- | --- |
| File System | 48 |
| FFindex-java | 30 |

## Write Times (JHM)
| Approach | bundle 190,000 files [s] |
| --- | --- |
| tar | 57 |
| tar + gzip | 166 |
| tar + pigz (multi-threaded) | 62 |
| FFindex-java (single-threaded) | 80 |
| FFindex-java (multi-threaded) | 12 |

## File Sizes (`du -sh`)
| Approach | size [GB] |
| --- | --- |
| plain directory | 3.8 |
| tar | 3.6 |
| tar + gzip | 3.5 |
| FFindex-java | 3.4 GB (data), 6.0 MB (index) |

# Usage
FFindex-java provides access to a "file bundle", i.e. a pair of a FFindex data file and an index file.

## Read-Only Bundles

Open a file bundle using:
```java
FileBundle readOnly = FileBundleIO.openBundle(dataPath, indexPath).inReadOnlyMode();
```

Bundles provide some information about the content of a bundle (like the number of files and the names of registered files).
Read individual files by invoking `#readFile(String filename)`.
All data read is returned as `ByteBuffer`.

## Appendable Bundles

```java
FileBundle appendable = FileBundleIO.openBundle(dataPath, indexPath).inAppendableMode();
```

Appendable bundles behave like read-only bundles but also provide several methods to write data using e.g. `#writeFile(String filename, byte[] content)`.
All data to write should be provided as `ByteBuffer`, if possible.

# Details & Limitations
No guarantees are made that files produced by this project are interoperable with the original FFindex files or 
implementations. This implementation is motivated by FFindex and produces identical files in simple cases. However, the
original FFindex anticipates index entries to be sorted (to perform binary search on it), this implementation writes 
entries in their insertion order and implements access by a map.

The maximum size of individual files to store is ~2 GB. The maximum number of files is capped by the size of Java arrays
as well.
